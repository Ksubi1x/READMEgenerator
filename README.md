Technologies used:

- NodeJS

- NPM

- FS Package

- Inquirer Package

- MarkdownGenerator Package


Tools:

- Visual Studio Code

Outcome:

Used nodeJS and npm to create the question prompts using inquirer where I put all the prompt questions that get asked when you run the project. once the prompts were asked and answered. A markdown file was made which contained the whole README with the users input in it.

Summary: I learned pretty much how to use the inquirer package and FS package which I have never used before, and I also got more hands on 
experience with using nodeJS
